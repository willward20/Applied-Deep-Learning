# Applied-Deep-Learning
This repository contains all of the neural network training programs written for my undergraduate engineering course on Applied Deep Learning (Fall 2022). The `assignments` folder contains jupyter notebooks for each assignment in the course. `cifar10_cnn.py` was the last assignment for the course, where we trained a convolutional neural network to classify images in the CIFAR10 dataset. 

Assignments include:
  1. **Numpy Basics** (sigmoid function, computing gradients, manipulating numpy arrays)
  2. **Logistic Regression** (logistic regression, forward and backward propagation, gradient descent, simple image classification)
  3. **Two-Layer Neural Network** (hidden layer parameters, computing cost, binary classification)
  4. **Multi-Layer Neural Network** (introduce ReLU activation, generalized hidden layer number and dimensions)
  5. **PyTorch Practice** (introduction to PyTorch, using built-in CIFAR10 dataset, train with pre-defined loss functions and optimizers)
  6. **Model Tuning** (observing the effects of changing hyperparameters)
  6. **Model Tuning with Optuna** (bonus assignment, learned how to use Optuna to automatically optimize hyperparameters)
  7. **ConvNet** (building a basic convolutional neural network; `cifar10_cnn.py` is a copy of this assignment in a Python file, instead of a jupyter notebook)
